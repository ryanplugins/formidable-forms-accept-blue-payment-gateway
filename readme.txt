Accept credit card payments through accept.blue directly inside your Formidable Forms.

== Description ==

**Secure Form Checkout** connects your Formidable Forms payment forms to the accept.blue payment processing platform. All card data is handled inside a secure accept.blue Hosted Tokenization iFrame — it never passes through your server, keeping your site PCI-compliant.

This is the **free Lite version**.

= What's Included in Lite =

* **Credit card payments** via accept.blue Hosted Tokenization iFrame — card data never touches your server
* **Test / Sandbox mode** — safely test payments with accept.blue sandbox credentials before going live
* **Test Connection** — verify your API credentials without leaving WordPress
* **Debug logging** — dedicated per-month log file with an in-admin log viewer, gated behind a settings toggle
* **3D Secure 2 (3DS2)** — optional EMV 3DS2 browser-based authentication per Form Action
* **Per-form API credential override** — run different forms against different accept.blue merchant accounts
* **Processing overlay** — animated spinner shown on form submit while payment processes
* **Minified assets** — production-ready JS and CSS; source files served automatically when WP_DEBUG is on


= Requirements =

* WordPress 6.0 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* Formidable Forms Pro (required for payment fields)
* An active accept.blue merchant account (sign up at https://accept.blue)

== Third-party Services ==

This plugin transmits payment data to accept.blue, a third-party payment processor. Card data is captured inside an accept.blue Hosted Tokenization iFrame and never passes through your server.

* accept.blue website: https://accept.blue
* accept.blue Terms of Service: https://accept.blue/legal/terms-of-service
* accept.blue Privacy Policy: https://accept.blue/legal/privacy-policy

No card data is stored on your server. All sensitive payment data is handled exclusively by accept.blue's PCI-compliant infrastructure.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this store card numbers on my server? =

No. Card data is tokenised entirely within the accept.blue Hosted Tokenization iFrame. Your server only ever receives a short-lived nonce token. No card numbers, CVVs, or expiry dates are stored on your server or in your database.

= Can I use this in test/sandbox mode? =

Yes. Enable Test / Sandbox Mode in Formidable > Global Settings > Accept.Blue and use your accept.blue sandbox credentials. No real charges are made. Disable the setting and switch to live credentials when you are ready for production.

= Can Lite run alongside the Pro version? =

No. Deactivate Lite before activating Pro. All PHP classes, functions, constants, database tables, and option keys are namespaced with _lite so there are no code-level conflicts, but running both simultaneously is unsupported.

= How is Lite different from Pro? =

Lite handles one-time credit card payments, 3DS2 authentication, per-form API credential overrides, and debug logging. Pro adds recurring billing, installment plans, auth-only/capture, refunds, voids, an admin transactions panel, webhooks, fraud protection, and a revenue dashboard.

= What statuses does the plugin use? =

complete — charge captured and settled; auth — authorised but not yet captured; failed — charge declined or errored; voided — authorisation cancelled before capture; refunded — charge refunded in full or in part.

= Does debug logging store sensitive data? =

API request and response bodies are logged when debug logging is enabled. Card numbers are never present (they are handled by the accept.blue iFrame and never reach your server), but disable debug logging once you have finished troubleshooting.

No card data is stored on your server. All sensitive payment data is handled exclusively by accept.blue's PCI-compliant infrastructure.
